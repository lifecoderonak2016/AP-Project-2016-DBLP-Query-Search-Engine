AP-Project-2016-DBLP-Query-Engine

This is my Advanced Programming Project 2016. The question was to build a Search Engine that could retrieve search results from a huge XML file given here in the link http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/dblp.xml.gz. This had to be implemented in Java using SAX Parser and I was given 3 queries to implement. The first two queries involved the use of searching with a efficient GUI and the last query involved the use of prediction which was implemented using Simple Regression and by some Machine Learning Techniques.
